# Chess Game â€“ My First React Project

This is my first React project!  
It's a two-player chess game built with React and Vite.

## About

- You can play chess with another person on the same computer.
- The game follows all standard chess rules, including castling, en passant, and pawn promotion.
- The interface is designed to be clean and modern, with a dark background and animated effects.
- You can start a new game or undo moves at any time.
- When a player wins by checkmate, a popup will appear announcing the winner.

I built this project to learn React and practice building interactive web applications.  
Enjoy playing!

_Based on the Vite + React starter template._
